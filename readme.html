      <div class="panel-content">It was hard to plan the DB and its connection to the website, registering new users,
        and find exiting ones, same for the products. We have not gone through it in class and we found it more
        difficulte than we imaganed it would be. Also, the tests part was harder than expected. It took me a long time to understand how to work with Jest</div>

      <div class="panel-content">As to the way we divded the work between us, I was inchagre of the backend.The begining was the hardest.
        The idea of what should be done was clear, but between understanding the idea, to implement it, there was quite some gap:<br>
        - Understanding the whole thing of await + fetch + HTTP methods<br>
        - Understanidng how to debug<br>
        - Understanding how our server can connect with the db - learning mongo's documantation<br>
        - Understanding the whole concept of cookies - req.cookies, res.cookies expected<br><br>

        BUT - After struggeling with the first real functionality contained each element should had been implemented -
        It was king of starting to go pretty smothly (of course not that smothly - but I could really debug things with understanding what is going on, and why, 
        and was not just changing things without understanding).<br>
        
        I did have struggeled a lot with adding the products each user added to cart to the db, without overwriting the last product was added.
        Unfortunetly, I wasn't succeeding in doing that. That was hard for me both trying, and both to decide leaving it, after hours and hours of trials :(

      <div class="panel-content">>Eden Vikler, 309840494, Eden was the one responsible for the frontend, for setting up the data in the db, was responsible for the tests and for dealing with DOS attacks. For what I was working on - can be inferred from the "what was hard part" :) I was working on the backend - routes, client, users - authentication and registration - using cookies and db, add to cart for user, searching in catalog, the admin functionality - ading new products to the store, user events. I also used my git experience from one of the courses here to try get us organize the project.</div>
